Karl Take Hit Animation Instructions

The animation has 4 frames. Frame 1 should hold for 0.1 secs and Frames 3 & 4 should hold for 0.2. Frame 2 should hold for 0.1 sec when the arms are being brought into his stomach and should hold for 0.2 when he's releasing his hold.
I will explain below.

The pattern should be:

1	2	3	4	3	2
	(0.1)				(0.2)

For audio, the animation lasts less than 2 seconds (approx).
