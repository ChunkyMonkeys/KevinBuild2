# KevinBuild2
New build with new scene use

// First Push

TITLE SCREEN SCENE

Working title screen with a start button that goes to the main virtual pet side of the game. Placeholder icons for future additions.

VIRTUAL PET

Movement code is in and working - ish. For some reason after the first walk, kevins speed increases a lot. 
Working Health and hunger bar. Working energy bar (Tested with code) but require mechanics to lower the energy. 
Placeholder buttons for changing room and subway. 
Map screen set up and requires code to be finished to toggle the map screen. Once in place changing between the virtual pet game and the arena game will be set up easily.

ARENA

 Empty scene for now.

ASSETS

 Folders condensed down and only vital assets for the game build are included.

SCRIPTS

 Original scripts have been carried over from the december build so any additions this semester have not been transferred over as of yet.
 With the exception of a new script for handling the subway map popup which is not yet properly finished.
